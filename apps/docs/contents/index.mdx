# Overview

Afilmory is a platform that transforms your photo collection into a fast, modern gallery. No database required—just point it at your photos and deploy.

## What is Afilmory?

Afilmory turns a photo folder (S3/B2/GitHub/local) into a fast, modern gallery. It processes your photos, generates thumbnails and metadata, and creates a beautiful web interface for browsing and viewing your collection.

## Key Features

- **WebGL-powered viewer** - Smooth zoom, pan, and navigation
- **Masonry grid layout** - Responsive photo grid with blurhash placeholders
- **Rich metadata** - EXIF data, Live Photo support, HDR detection, Fujifilm recipe details
- **Map view** - Visualize geotagged photos on an interactive map
- **SEO-ready** - Server-side rendering support for better discoverability
- **No database** - Everything runs from static files and manifests

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Git** installed
- **pnpm** package manager
- **Node.js 20+** installed
- Access to a photo source (S3/B2/GitHub/local/Eagle)

## Quick Start

Get your gallery running in 3 steps:

1. **Copy config**: `cp config.example.json config.json`, then set your name, links, and accent color
2. **Choose storage**: Go to [Storage Providers](/storage/providers) and configure your photo source
3. **Build and deploy**: Run `pnpm run build:manifest` to generate thumbnails and manifest, then deploy

For detailed instructions, see the [Quick Start Guide](/getting-started/quick-start).

## Deployment Options

Afilmory supports two deployment modes:

### Static Hosting (Easiest)

Publish your built files to any static host—GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, or any CDN. No servers, no maintenance.

- **Best for**: Simple deployments, cost-effective hosting
- **Limitations**: Basic SEO, no server-rendered meta tags

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Use the Next.js wrapper for enhanced SEO and Open Graph support. Deploy to Vercel or any Node.js host.

- **Best for**: Better SEO, social media previews, dynamic meta tags
- **Requirements**: Node.js runtime

See [Architecture](/architecture) for a detailed comparison.
